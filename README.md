You can view the doodle prototype at this [link](https://pcsong33.github.io/doodle-app/). The distinguishing feature of Doodle is the ability to click on available time, rather than dragging a selection of available times as in When2meet. Additionally, specific blocks of time are proposed by the event organizer in Doodle, and users must "accept" to attending an entire block of time.

### App Features
- View a list of availabilities defined by the event organizer
- View the availabilites of other attendees
- Mark your availibity as "yes" or "if neessary"
- You're only able to submit the form if at least one availability has been selected

Note that in the official Doodle App, users are able to toggle between "yes" and "if neessary" by clicking a checkbox. In the prototype, this is implemented using multiple radio buttons.
